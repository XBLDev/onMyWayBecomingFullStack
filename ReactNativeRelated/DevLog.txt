The reasons why the video recorded with HuaWei mate 8 can not merge with the drone video:

1. Even with the original iphone video, I had to convert both the iphone video and the drone video to 30 FPS, before I can merge them. The 
video recorded with HuaWei is not converted, therefore can not merge with the drone video.

This is the primary reason this MVP can't be actually achieved for now: as long as the mobile phone video needs to be mannually converted to the same 
frame rate as the drone video, it can't merge RIGHT AFTER THE VIDEO IS RECORDED, and that's in the MVP 1 spec.

2. The phone video size is: 368 * 656. And the drone video size is 1920 * 1080. My tool cannot change a small sized video to a big sized video, so 
I had to down-size the drone video to 369 * 656 first. And somehow after that, no matter how I convert both videos, they just won't merge, or rather 
it will give you a dialog telling you they merge, and there's a merged video file, but there's nothing in that file, just pitch black.

I suspect that if the mobile phone video was originally recorded 368 * 656, there are certain things that are just not compatiable with any video 
that was recorded 1920 * 1080. However since I can merge them with the webtool: http://www.aconvert.com/video/merge/#, I can't say i'm entirely sure
about it.

Conclusion:

1. The MVP cannot be achieved as long as the mobile/drone videos have to be mannually converted before they can merge.
2. I'm adding the video recording function to the generated apk, so maybe record some random videos and see what size are the videos recorded. Maybe
with the video recorded 1920 * 1080, they can merge after convert.
3. I think I'll keep looking into viable solutions that can convert videos in-app, or any possible way that can merge videos without converting them.

But I won't spend too much time on this project until I actually find a solution or anything like it, since I think it will take a long time to find 
a solution, potentially involving mitigating to another development tool other than react-native.

The solution to the waiting time for downloading drone video is simple: use the setState callback, since the callback is only executed 
after the download is finished, it's safe to put the merging function in it such that the video merging happens right after the download 
is finished.

The app can now download the video from Amazon S3, and merge it with the video from user's mobile phone.

It turns out that the reason it couldn't download the video was because I used a folder where it just simply can't keep any of the 
downloaded files, and the one that works is the "Download" folder, and the trick here is: it wouldn't work if you just hard code the 
path, you have to use the constant path that represents the Download folder in order for the file to be downloaded.

It's true that the user can't merge the 2 videos unless they are both on the phone, but after download there's another problem: because 
it takes time to download the video, if the merged is executed right after the download, the merge will simply just fail.

So for now, the entire download + merge process is divided into 2 seperate steps, with 2 buttons that execute them. I have to use 
the UI to indicate that the file is downloaded before I press the merge button. It's just for MVP so it's OK, but it has to be fixed later 
on for it to be a complete ONE function.

As for now the entire process of merging 2 videos is:
1. Put the videos on Amazon S3
2. In meteor backend, put the URLs of these videos in a DB
3. The backend publish the DB
4. The frontend subscribe the DB
5. The user can choose, for now, one drone video from the subscribed list of drone videos
6. The user choose another one or more videos taken on the phone
7. The user click on the download button to download the drone video, this step will be combined with step 8 in the future.
8. After the video is downloaded, the user merge the drone video with their own videos, possibly delete the downloaded drone video after that.

The development of this app is being halted until given further instructions.

Started on backend, or rather how to reach the drone videos put on S3 through simple backend setup, which is basically just a 
list of the video URLS.

Yesterday i couldn't play the videos even after I got the URLs read from DB, and it seems that it's got nothing to do with my code:
I simply change the gradle settings such that they are the same as the settings in ReactNativeVideoEditor, and added all sorts of 
setups that should happen in MainApplication.java and build.gradle/gradle.settings, and it worked, the video plays.

So for now it seems that the idea of how to get the remote videos work: putting them on a remote server, which is Amazon S3 in this 
case, put all the video URLs in a DB on Meteor Galaxy, make the backend publish it and frontend subscribe it, and finally use the 
list of URLs to play the video.

The process of choosing user videos is pretty much the same as RNVideoEditor, the only difference is that now the chosen drone video 
has to be added to the final list for merging.

But the videos won't merge: it gives an error which indicates that there's something wrong with not my code, but rather it's something 
related to the underlying ReactVideoEditor code.

I suspect that it's because the videos on the server are not downloaded, which caused the merger fail to merge. Therefore I explored file 
download with: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-fetch-blob. Doesn't seem to work at all, no matter what settings I use, it simply 
just won't download anything.

Today's focus: UIs related to video playing, and for the last 3,4 hours started working on backend.

For the video UIs it's mostly just a replication of the react-native-video-controller: 
https://github.com/itsnubix/react-native-video-controls

This package provides an almost complete UI interface for video: play, pause, current time, duration etc. But turns out 
it doesn't have the drag bar that can set time as it shows in github. The current UI I made have play, time which currently 
displays time in seconds, and an expand button that hopefully can make video go full screen in the future.

The rough ideas behind how users can reach to drone videos that are on remote server:
1. put the drone videos on Amazon S3, which is just a temporary solution. In the future is has to be automatically uploaded somehow.
2. In the backend, create/get new DB for drone videos, and add 2 URLs of the supported videos if that DB has no records.
3. After create/get drone video DB and adding 2 videos, publish it so the front end can subscribe it.
4. In the front end, subscribe to the DB that's published by server, and make a list object receive all the records
5. Use the URLs to play videos.

Currently, using the URLs to play video gives me error saying something like undefined constants, don't know the cause of it, 
maybe related to package versions.

Today I mainly worked on designing a more professional looking UI, the 2 references I used for UI design today were:

https://www.winxdvd.com/resource/free-video-merger-software-download.htm,  a free video merger software, which I 
used to use merge videos yesterday before I downloaded handbrake

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appzcloud.mergevideoeditor, an android app that's used to merge videos.

Some of the basic ideas here:
1. At the bottom, there are several buttons that enable users to do the operations on the highest level: add new videos 
to the list, remove all the videos in the list, merge, and probably some new buttons in the future, such as a download 
button that enables users to download drone videos from some remote server.
2. When there's no video added, it tells you that you need at least 2 videos to merge into a new one. 
3. For each list item that represents a selected video, it now contains 2 parts: on the left, a thumbnail of the video  
with a play button that enable user to play the video; on the top half of the right, it lists some of the video information 
such as video size, video name etc, and on the bottom half it has 3 buttons: move up, move down, and remove, which moves video 
up, moves video down, and removes video from the list accordingly.

Problems:
1. If in the future the number of high level operations increase, on row of button on the bottom may not be enough, and 
therefore there might be some design issues related to space, possibly making one button that can collapse into a list 
of buttons is a better idea.
2. Maybe when there's no video added, a good UX idea is that the "add video" button should flash so the user can notice it 
much eaiser.
3. I'm not sure the current setup is the best one, or even a good one, there should be better designs that can use the limited 
space better.
4. Can't get the length of the video, it doesn't seem to be contained in the returned video when it's fetched.
5. The users may not understand what the 3 buttons mean until they try them, not really a big problem though.
6. The next step will be expanding the UI so underneath the clicked list item, there's a bigger space for playing the video, and 
the problem is that, there will have to be several buttons related to just playing the video, such as pause, stop etc.
7. Also, the user may want to trim the video, not sure how to design the UI yet.

####################################################################################################################################################################################

11/07/2017:

Since no new video for further video merging investigation, today's focus was: 
1. Making UI components that enable users to add/remove videos, and change order of videos which will affect
in what order the videos are merged.
2. After selecting the videos, in the generated video list, organize each list item as following: on the left 
of the list item, is a mini video playing as sort of a thumbnail for video, and when that item is clicked, a 
bigger drop down video appears underneath the list item, along with 3 buttons: "up", "down", and "remove". The 
first 2 will increase/decrease the order of the selected video accordingly, and "remove" will ask you if you are 
sure about deleting the video from list upon clicking on it, and will delete it if you click on yes.
3. Investigate video trimming, which could be important in the future.
4. Giving the list items some border so it's easier to tell 2 videos apart.

Problems for the points above:
1. There are times when I first choose some videos, and then try to add some other videos, it gives me an aynsc 
error. Not really sure about the cause, seems to be linked to videoPicker cleaning.
2. The 3 buttons need better UI design so they look professional, possibly with icons, which I failed to use today 
with list items.
3. The video trimming has some serious issues: when I trim the videos taken by my mobile phone, it works fine; however,
when I trim the drone video supplied by Jeremy, the following are the results:
            //start time -> end time:  result video length
            //1 -> 5: 9 seconds
            //1 -> 6: 9 seconds
            //1 -> 7: 9 seconds
            //1 -> 8: 9 seconds
            //1 -> 9: 9 seconds
            //1 -> 10: 19 seconds
            //1 -> 11: 19 seconds
            //1 -> 12, with video shot by mobile phone: 12 seconds
            //1 -> 13, with video shot by mobile phone: 13 seconds
The concolusion is, when trimming the drone video, it seems that the start time and end time simply don't matter, there's 
a pattern for sure, but not good enough such that i can derive some sort of mathematical solution from it so solve this problem.
4. I think for the border, it's better to give the selected video a green one, and the video before/after it some other color, 
but since the way the scrollview list items are generated, that seems to be impossible to do. It can be achieved by writing 
lots of redundant code, but that's not a good way to do it. And between videos there should be white space to seperate them.

10/07/2017:

Up until 2:40, been trying to merge the 2 videos supplied by Jeremy, one taken by DJI, one taken by iphone, 
both videos are of MOV format.

There are several problems related to file format:
1. On my samsung Galaxy, it simply won't play/show any MOV format videos, when you copy/past the videos,
it will ask you to convert it to WMV format, which will enable the app and the mobile phone to play the 
video, but since the merger app only accepts MP4 videos as input, they have to be converted to MP4.
2. Once converted to MP4, for the DJI video: it can read by the merger app but cannot be played, and it 
can not be played by Samsung Galaxy; for the iphone video: it can be played by the mobile phone, but 
can not be read/played by the merger app.

The solution takes the following steps:
1. Converted both videos with online video converter: https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/cloud-converter
2. Download handbrake from: https://handbrake.fr/
3. Change the framerate of both videos to 30 using handbrake, generated new files
4. Put the new files to Samsung Galaxy
5. Open the merger app, now the 2 videos can be merged into one.

Some technical concerns:
1. Not really sure if the above way is the only way, and even if there are other ways to do it, it's still 
not good enough since we need to use external tools to convert both videos first.
2. Not sure if the same approach will work on iphone, or any other android devices.
3. The way the merger app decides which video comes first in the merged video now, is that it chooses the 
video that's last modified: if the drone video was taken after the user took the video, when the 2 videos 
are merged, the drone video will come first and the user video will come last, which in our case is wrong.
There should be some way to change the order of the videos though.
4. 30 framerate is just a random number chose by me, maybe some other framerate is better choice than 30.
5. It takes quite a time to generate the output video, not too long but long enough if the user wants the use 
that generated video to do something else right after it's merged.
6. The VLC media player, which people use to play videos, has its progress bar stuck at 4s, but the video 
keeps going. Other video players, including the one on mobile phone and the one used by Dropbox, seem to be
working properly.
7. The video player used by facebook messenger seems to be stuck too at 3/4s

Just fired Lenovo Tango phone up, and the videos which I thought were not there the other day appeared. It seems 
that on Tango it might take longer to generate the videos, but eventually they will be there.

The merging works on Tango.

It looks like there's no need for me to convert the videos using the website: I just downloaded the videos from 
dropbox, changed the framerates of both videos to 30 using handbrake, and they can merge. So as long as we 
can find a way to change the framerate of the videos without using any external tool it's good to go.

The experiment of "better video line up by trimming the drone video" didn't go well: it still looks odd when transitioning 
from the first video to the second video. Video trimming component might be needed in the future, if users think 
it's a good idea to cut part of some videos so the final result looks better.

Made a better UI for video preview: now after the users select the videos, they will see a list of video names/URLS
instead of a list of every video being played. And they can see the corresponding video by clicking on one of the 
list items. This way the UI looks much more elegant and it's easier to use, plus we can add more button options for different 
operations such as changing the order of the videos, remove one of the videos etc, without having to look at too many videos 
at the same time.

Tried to implement video order changing by moving a certain video up/down in the list, ran out of time to do that, may 
finish it tomorrow. In the future could design some drag and drop functions if it's doable.

####################################################################################################################################################################################

07/07/2017:

Made a component that can let user choose multiple videos on the phone, and merge them, basically a 
combination of the code from these 2 github repositories:

https://github.com/MostWantIT/react-native-video-editor
https://github.com/ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker

Plus a lot of UI changes to make it usable, but the UI still needs a lot of improvements, which I 
attempted to do in a seperate component. The idea is that once select the videos, only display a list 
of the videos, and once the user click on one of the list item, it shows a drop down window that plays 
the video, and it disappears if the user clicks on the same item again. It's doable, and should make 
the UI much better.

####################################################################################################################################################################################

Delivered the app that can merge 2 videos together, the code is from: 
https://github.com/MostWantIT/react-native-video-editor
But it needs to change the package version numbers, and possibly a bunch of other things so 
that it can add other packages or be added to another app as a component. And slight UI changes.

Problems with the app is that: 
1. the UI is very inconvinient to use, after merging 2 videos, the user can not go back to 
taking videos again. 
2. It says the merged video is saved, but actually in the original code in the package there's a bug, 
or rather file path format error, that stops the merged video from being saved. The solution is that 
in the original react-native-video-editor, I used the path that can be used to save the video taken 
by the user, and the merged video can be saved. But, this seems to be only working on my mobile phone: 
Samsung Galaxy, on Lenovo Tango, on which i also tested the app, the merging can be done but the videos, 
included the sub-videos, are not saved anywhere, at least i can't find them.
