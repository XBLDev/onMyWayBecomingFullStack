Made a component that can let user choose multiple videos on the phone, and merge them, basically a 
combination of the code from these 2 github repositories:

https://github.com/MostWantIT/react-native-video-editor
https://github.com/ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker

Plus a lot of UI changes to make it usable, but the UI still needs a lot of improvements, which I 
attempted to do in a seperate component. The idea is that once select the videos, only display a list 
of the videos, and once the user click on one of the list item, it shows a drop down window that plays 
the video, and it disappears if the user clicks on the same item again. It's doable, and should make 
the UI much better.

Delivered the app that can merge 2 videos together, the code is from: 
https://github.com/MostWantIT/react-native-video-editor
But it needs to change the package version numbers, and possibly a bunch of other things so 
that it can add other packages or be added to another app as a component. And slight UI changes.

Problems with the app is that: 
1. the UI is very inconvinient to use, after merging 2 videos, the user can not go back to 
taking videos again. 
2. It says the merged video is saved, but actually in the original code in the package there's a bug, 
or rather file path format error, that stops the merged video from being saved. The solution is that 
in the original react-native-video-editor, I used the path that can be used to save the video taken 
by the user, and the merged video can be saved. But, this seems to be only working on my mobile phone: 
Samsung Galaxy, on Lenovo Tango, on which i also tested the app, the merging can be done but the videos, 
included the sub-videos, are not saved anywhere, at least i can't find them.
