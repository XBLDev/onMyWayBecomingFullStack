Comment on React Native:

1. Facebook provides a set of tools for building android app, the complie speed is better than using Android Studio.
2. React Native can show change on screen without re-compile, similar to the fast-compile function of Android Studio. But for now there's bug related
to the port number(8088/8081) that make fast compile not usable. Should find a way to enable this function to speed up production.
3. React Native can be developed without Android Studio, and the web simulation can give error logs for debugging.

First page animation is easy, still need to find a way to transition from 1st to 2nd page.

I thought i can use state update to indicate whether the fadeout animation of previous page is finished so i can go onto the next page, but somehow the state 
update is in certain cases not detected, and even when detected, it's not happening on the second page: i have to go back to the first page to see that pen change 
to a green apple. Maybe there's something fundamentally wrong with the way I do it.

General suggestion from website: DO NOT USE ANIMATED() FOR ANIMATION, and that's exactly what i've been doing all this time.

WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO: with the head icon/pic/image, when clicked, first fade out, change the image from the pen to the apple, and fade in.

More specifically, i want the end of the animation to serve as the indicator that the fade out is finished, and from there change the image and fade in.

I think it should be easy to handle other animations once this one is done. Seemingly small task, but already spent 3 days on it.

Seems that i can't have everything: either the image changes without animation, or animation without image change, and sometimes when the image changes, 
it's just a flash and the image disappears. The callback either not working, or the image changes but no animation.

Some other animation options: 

1. lottie the react native plugin, tried running it, but it seems that it requires a couple more plugins to install, and i don't think it can actually do what i need, 
besides, it won't be possible to show the result on the web simulator if i use that plugin, which is the problem for any other animation APIs that requires importing some 
other dependencies.

2. LayoutAnimation and react-native-animatable: suggestion from this website: https://blog.bam.tech/developper-news/5-tips-to-make-a-great-component-to-page-animation-in-react-native, both require more dependencies, and not really well documented either. The LayoutAnimation looks more usable though, it has official documentation.

Some quotes from a stackoverflow question:

"I have several active animations in a component. When I am trying to update a component state during these animations they stop due to the rerendering process. Is there any way to prevent this from happening?"

So it looks like updating a state can stop animations.
