Comment on React Native:

1. Facebook provides a set of tools for building android app, the complie speed is better than using Android Studio.
2. React Native can show change on screen without re-compile, similar to the fast-compile function of Android Studio. But for now there's bug related
to the port number(8088/8081) that make fast compile not usable. Should find a way to enable this function to speed up production.
3. React Native can be developed without Android Studio, and the web simulation can give error logs for debugging.

First page animation is easy, still need to find a way to transition from 1st to 2nd page.

I thought i can use state update to indicate whether the fadeout animation of previous page is finished so i can go onto the next page, but somehow the state 
update is in certain cases not detected, and even when detected, it's not happening on the second page: i have to go back to the first page to see that pen change 
to a green apple. Maybe there's something fundamentally wrong with the way I do it.
