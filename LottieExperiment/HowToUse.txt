Steps: 

1. Download/install After Effects

2. Install bodymovin plugin for AE: https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin, may have to restart AE to use it.

3. Make some animation/composition

4. In AE, go to "windows" -> "Extension" -> "Bodymovin"

5. Specify a destination path for the generated JSON file, and generate it, name it "EddyAppAnimation.json"

6. Copy paste the generated file to: ROOT_PATH_OF_REACT_NATIVE_FOLDER/node_modules/animations

7. Re-arrange the file into the following format: 
{
"assets":[...],
"layers":[...],
"v":"4.4.26",
"ddd":0,
"ip":0,
"op":180,
"fr":30,
"w":400,
"h":300
}

Not sure how much the format/order of elements affects the app, but this order works for other examples from LottieNative github: 
https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-react-native

8. Make sure "op" is integer: in the generated JSON file it's something like "30.000000000009", and somehow that stops the app from working

9. Not sure if other long floating numbers should be changed to intergers, op seems to be the only one causing trouble so far.

10. Copy the code from "LottieExperiment.js" to "index.android.js" (won't work on web simulator since it can't install plugins)



I followed the first tutorial on this page:

I changed XORZO to EddyApp, can't see the text, everything else is good.

The Lottie plugin may not support text.
